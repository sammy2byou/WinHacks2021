# WinHacks2021
The Challenge: The geographic area which covers a vast terrain from Chatham-Kent down to Windsor-Essex and including Leamington is home to many agriculture-based businesses and greenhouses. We seek to better understand them through a convenient web-based dashboard which aggregates information regarding the agriculture and greenhouse businesses in the region (Chatham-Kent to Windsor-Essex inclusive) and provides key details such as:

		• Business name			• Contact information (phone, email, and so on)
		• Business website		• Social media (if applicable)
		• Business address		• Business owner contact information (if available)
		• Business type			• Brief business description

Using the resources available to you such as free Google Cloud Credits and a free domain from Domain.com, please create and prepare a demonstration of this dashboard.
Your dashboard should:

	• Be simple enough for a non-technical business development representative to use and understand.
	• Should be published live and accessible via a simple URL.
	• At minimum, include the information identified in the previous section.
	• Be as complete as possible.
